Monster Hunter: an Interactive Story was my final project for my 1st semester Programming class, the game is written in C# and uses .txt files to story the story text as well as the save data, the actual story is protected by a HASH code.

# Error Checking

The game is designed with modularity in mind, and will provide error messages if the files are missing or corrupted, the story.txt file itself is protected by a HASH code so that no unauthroised changes can be made.

# InGame Achivement Recording

By writing and then reading to a text file the game is able to keep track of all the endings the player has gotten, recording them as achivements.

# Persistance

The game allows saving games as well as keeping track of the currernt ammount of achivements the player has recived, allowing the player to come back to the game without loosing all data.

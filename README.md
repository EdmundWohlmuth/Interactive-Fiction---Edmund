# Monster Hunter: an Interactive Story

(Monster Hunter is owned and published by CAPCOM)

Monster Hunter: an Interactive Story was my final project for my 1st semester Programming class, the game is written in C# and uses .txt files to story the story text as well as the save data, the actual story is protected by a HASH code.

# Error Checking

The game is designed with modularity in mind, and will provide error messages if the files are missing or corrupted, the story.txt file itself is protected by a HASH code so that no unauthroised changes can be made.
